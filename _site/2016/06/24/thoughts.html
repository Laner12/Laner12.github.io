<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<p>June 24, 2016</p>
<div class="text"><p>Some thoughts I have at the moment as I write this blog post are as follows. First off, I continuously find myself thinking about how to get the most out of my day. Following that initial thought, I begin to dive deeper into possible changes that I could make ranging from self-dicipline to creating ordered lists. I will generally spend a decent amount of time on this subject before I realize what might be my issue. This realization, of course, is that I spend far too much time thinking about how to make my day more efficient while I am actively making it inefficient by wasting time.</p></div>
